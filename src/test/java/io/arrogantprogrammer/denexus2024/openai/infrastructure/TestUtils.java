            In the heart of the Force, a wise soul dwells,
            Yoda, a master of tales he tells.
            With ears that listen to the galaxy's song,
            In his presence, we feel where we belong.
                        
            In a swampy domain, he makes his abode,
            A Jedi grandmaster, on the Force's road.
            His words are a beacon, shining bright,
            Guiding us through the darkest night.
                        
            "Size matters not," he gently imparts,
            "Judge me by my size, do you?" he starts.
            With a lightsaber and wisdom as his shield,
            In the Force's embrace, he is revealed.
                        
            Through trials and tests, he guides the way,
            Teaching us to learn, to grow, to stay.
            A mentor, a sage, in the Jedi's lore,
            Yoda's teachings echo forevermore.
                        
            In his eyes, a twinkle, a spark of mirth,
            A reminder that even in darkness, there's birth.
            With the Force as his ally, and truth as his light,
            Yoda's wisdom shines, ever bright.
